    <p>The percent Cloudiness where negative Latitude is closer to the south pole,<br>
        and positive Latitude is closer to the north pole.<br><br>
        North, south and close to the equator can have low and high Cloudiness.<br>
        There are a lot of density at some rounded numbers, ie:  0, 20, 40, 75, and 100.<br>
        This is due to human rounding by meteoroligist.</p>
