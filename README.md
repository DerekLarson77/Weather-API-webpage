# Web-Design-Challenge

A Website that has 7 pages hosted through Github.
Github website is located at:  dereklarson77.github.io

All pages have a navigation bar at the top that can be used to navigate between all 7 pages.

The welcome page has a discription of how the data was minipulated to create 4 graphs.  There is a sidebar with graph 
thumbnails as an additional option to navigate to that specific graph's page.

The 4 graphs have their own page with the graph displaying, and an explanation of what can be determined by the graph.

There is a comparison page that has all 4 graphs displaying simultaneously.

The last page displays an html table of all the data used.
